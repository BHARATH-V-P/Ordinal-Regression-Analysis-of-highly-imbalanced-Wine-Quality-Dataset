# Ordinal-Regression-Analysis-of-highly-imbalanced-Wine-Quality-Dataset

This project involves building a classification model to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The aim is to analyze feature relevance
for specific classes gven the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, optimize models to help improve predictability and visualize specific patterns from the dataset. The problem in hand is treated as an Ordinal Regression problem where the main objective is to improve the Cohen Kappa Score.
